<h2>Historical Background</h2>
<p>A Military Department was created in the Supreme Government of the East India Company at Kolkata into the year 1776,
having the main function to sift and record orders relating to the Army issued by various Departments of the
Govt of East India Co. The Military Department initially functioned as a branch of the Public Department and maintained
a list of Army personnel. With the Charter Act of 1833 the Secretariat of the Government of East India Company
was reorganised into four Departments, including a Military Department, each headed by a Secretary to the Government.
The Army in the Presidencies of Bengal, Bombay & Madras functioned as respective Presidency Army till April 1895, 
when the Presidency Armies were unified into a single Indian Army. For administrative convenience, 
it was divided into four Commands viz. Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal, Madras (including Burma) 
and Bombay (including Sind, Quetta and Aden). The supreme authority over the Indian Army vested in the 
Governor General-in-Council, subject to the Control of the Crown, which was exercised by the Secretary of State for India.
Two Members in the Council were responsible for military affairs, one of whom was the Military Member, 
who supervised all administrative and financial matters, while the other was the Commander-in-Chief who was responsible
for all operational matters. The Military Department was abolished in March 1906 and it was replaced
by two separate Departments, the Army Department and the Military Supply Department.
In April 1909 the Military Supply Department was abolished and its functions were taken over by the Army Department.
The Army Department was redesignated as the Defence Department in January 1938.
The Department of Defence became the Ministry of Defence under a Cabinet Minister in August 1947.</p>
