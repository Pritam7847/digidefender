                <h1>About The Ministry</h1>
                <p>The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is a key government department responsible for implementing defense policies and
                    ensuring the security and sovereignty of a nation. It oversees the armed forces, including the army, navy,
                    and air force, and is tasked with protecting the country from external threats, managing military operations,
                    and maintaining readiness for combat. The MoD also plays a vital role in shaping defense strategies,
                    procuring military equipment, and coordinating with international allies on defense matters.</p>
    
                <p>In addition to its military responsibilities, the Ministry of Defence is often involved in disaster relief,
                    humanitarian missions, and peacekeeping efforts, both domestically and abroad. It works closely with other
                    government agencies, such as intelligence services and foreign ministries, to ensure a comprehensive approach
                    to national security. The MoD is typically headed by a senior minister or secretary of defense, who is
                    responsible for advising the government on defense matters and making critical decisions regarding the
                    deployment and use of military resources.</p>
